# Weather-station

# Description:
This project aims to create an Internet of Things (IoT) environmental monitoring system using the ESP8266 D1 Mini microcontroller board. The system collects temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor and visualizes it in real-time on a web-based dashboard. It utilizes WebSocket communication for real-time data transmission and Chart.js for dynamic chart generation.

# Features:
1. Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring.
2. Web-based dashboard for data visualization.
3. Adjustable data transmission rate via WebSocket.
4. Responsive design for viewing on various devices.
5. Background image customization.
6. Scalable chart display with adjustable canvas size.

# Hardware Requirements:
- ESP8266 D1 Mini microcontroller board.
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
- Breadboard and jumper wires.

# Software Requirements:
- Arduino IDE for ESP8266 development.
- Necessary libraries: ESP8266WiFi, ESP8266WebServer, WebSocketsServer, DHT.

# Installation and Setup:
1. Connect the DHT11 sensor to the ESP8266 D1 Mini as per the circuit diagram.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and install the required libraries.
3. Copy the provided code into a new sketch.
4. Update the Wi-Fi credentials (SSID and password) in the code.
5. Upload the sketch to the ESP8266 D1 Mini board.
6. Access the web-based dashboard by entering the IP address of the ESP8266 D1 Mini in a web browser.

# Usage:
- Adjust the data transmission rate using the slider on the dashboard.
- View real-time temperature and humidity data on the chart.
- Customize the background image by replacing the URL in the HTML code.
